ALK	238	F1174L	neuroblastoma	769	Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	Cells lines expressing ALK harboring the F1174L mutation are less sensitive to growth inhibition by crizotinib than cells expressing the R1275Q mutation.	22072639	Bresler et al., 2011, Sci Transl Med	3

AKT1	207	E17K	breast cancer	1612	MK-2206		Predictive	Does Not Support	Sensitivity	PIK3CA mutation, but not AKT1 E17K, has been shown to confer sensitiity to the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in breast cancer cell lines.	23888070	Beaver et al., 2013, Clin. Cancer Res.	3
ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	acute myeloid leukemia	9119	Arsenic trioxide		Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome positive leukemias with Arsenic Trioxide results in high rates of complete remission in patients.	12476305	Nimmanapalli et al., 2002, Oncogene	5
ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	chronic myeloid leukemia	8552	Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	The clinical use of imatinib in patients with BCR-ABL fusion has drastic sensitivity to the drug.	20537386	An et al., 2010, Leuk. Res.	5
ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	chronic myeloid leukemia	8552	Imatinib		Prognostic	Supports	Better Outcome	BCR-ABL inhibitors such as imatinib have lead to "significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens."	20537386	An et al., 2010, Leuk. Res.	5
ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	chronic myeloid leukemia	8552	Nilotinib		Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	The use of second-generation BCR-ABL targeted therapies has shown signifcantly greater response in patients resistant to imatinib.	20537386	An et al., 2010, Leuk. Res.	4

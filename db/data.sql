CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal\n  AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation\n  in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha\n  protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription\n  factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1\n  and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations\n  may have prognostic implications.\nofficial_name: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha\nclinical_description: \ndeleted: false\ndeleted_at: \n	1	\N	\N	f9127a41-13a9-465b-b876-52696af7b7b4	2015-07-31 17:34:17.343161

Unlike the association\n  with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated\n  with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.\nofficial_name: isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble\nclinical_description: \ndeleted: false\ndeleted_at: \n	1	\N	\N	087c3e9e-4062-4ab8-819f-46b2d6ae2dff	2015-07-31 17:34:20.029131

1	238	ALK	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.	anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase	2015-07-31 17:34:13.793019	2015-07-31 17:34:13.793019	\N	f	\N
2	207	AKT1	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, is a known oncogene. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.	v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1	2015-07-31 17:34:14.151121	2015-07-31 17:34:14.151121	\N	f	\N
3	369	ARAF	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.

4	25	ABL1	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.	ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase	2015-07-31 17:34:14.70456	2015-07-31 17:34:14.70456	\N	f	\N
5	673	BRAF	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.

6	672	BRCA1	BRCA1 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy indivudals to assess risk.	breast cancer 1, early onset	2015-07-31 17:34:15.221179	2015-07-31 17:34:15.221179	\N	f	\N
7	675	BRCA2	BRCA2 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy indivudals to assess risk.	breast cancer 2, early onset	2015-07-31 17:34:15.494667	2015-07-31 17:34:15.494667	\N	f	\N
8	595	CCND1	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	cyclin D1	2015-07-31 17:34:15.723169	2015-07-31 17:34:15.723169	\N	f	\N
9	894	CCND2	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	cyclin D2	2015-07-31 17:34:15.95645	2015-07-31 17:34:15.95645	\N	f	\N
10	896	CCND3	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts.	cyclin D3	2015-07-31 17:34:16.138411	2015-07-31 17:34:16.138411	\N	f	\N
11	898	CCNE1	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its cyclin D counterparts, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. In lung cancer, neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their more lowly expressed counterparts.	cyclin E1	2015-07-31 17:34:16.354744	2015-07-31 17:34:16.354744	\N	f	\N
12	1021	CDK6	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	cyclin-dependent kinase 6	2015-07-31 17:34:16.560511	2015-07-31 17:34:16.560511	\N	f	\N
13	1019	CDK4	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	cyclin-dependent kinase 4	2015-07-31 17:34:16.779759	2015-07-31 17:34:16.779759	\N	f	\N
14	1029	CDKN2A	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. One mechanism by which loss of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. However, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A	2015-07-31 17:34:17.080685	2015-07-31 17:34:17.080685	\N	f	\N
15	1050	CEBPA	AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha	2015-07-31 17:34:17.336322	2015-07-31 17:34:17.336322	\N	f	\N
16	3337	DNAJB1	DNAJB1 works upstream of MDM2, stabilizing the complex and facilitating p53 turnover. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.	DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1	2015-07-31 17:34:17.584234	2015-07-31 17:34:17.584234	\N	f	\N
17	5566	PRKACA	PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.	protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, catalytic, alpha	2015-07-31 17:34:17.796577	2015-07-31 17:34:17.796577	\N	f	\N
18	1788	DNMT3A	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations.

19	1956	EGFR	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer.	epidermal growth factor receptor	2015-07-31 17:34:18.27427	2015-07-31 17:34:18.27427	\N	f	\N
20	2064	ERBB2	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is amplified in HER2-positive breast cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast cancer. Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2	2015-07-31 17:34:18.532265	2015-07-31 17:34:18.532265	\N	f	\N
21	2099	ESR1	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, but has also shown significance in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types. ER-positive breast cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	estrogen receptor 1	2015-07-31 17:34:18.778991	2015-07-31 17:34:18.778991	\N	f	\N
22	2263	FGFR2	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.	fibroblast growth factor receptor 2	2015-07-31 17:34:19.057189	2015-07-31 17:34:19.057189	\N	f	\N

24	2322	FLT3	FLT3 is an important cytokine receptor involved in normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.	fms-related tyrosine kinase 3	2015-07-31 17:34:19.535843	2015-07-31 17:34:19.535843	\N	f	\N
25	2624	GATA2	GATA2 is a transcription factor involved in stem cell maintenance with key roles in hematopoietic development. GATA2 mutations are associated with a variety of inherited and acquired immune disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition to a role in hematopoiesis, the maintenance GATA2 expression has been implicated as a requirement in KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical models have indicated therapeutic benefit from targeting GATA2-mediated pathways in the context of KRAS-driven NSCLC.

26	3417	IDH1	IDH1 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble	2015-07-31 17:34:20.020936	2015-07-31 17:34:20.020936	\N	f	\N
27	3418	IDH2	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. Although IDH2 (R172) mutations are associated with poorer overall prognosis in AML patients, its utility as a prognostic marker in MDS is still under debate. Additionally, IDH2 (R140) has been associated with improved overall survival in AML. IDH2 mutations have been associated with improved prognosis in gliomas.	isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+), mitochondrial	2015-07-31 17:34:20.275254	2015-07-31 17:34:20.275254	\N	f	\N
28	3717	JAK2	JAK2 is a kinase that is misregulated or mutated in a number of myeloproliferative diseases and cancers. The mutation V617F is the most clinically relevant variant, and is seen in around half of myeloproliferative disorders. The variant is a known activating mutation, and activated JAK2 is sufficient to drive myeloproliferative disorders in mouse models. V617F, while most recurrent, is not the only mechanism by which JAK2 can be activated in patients. JAK2 is now one of the first diagnostic markers tested upon diagnosis with a myeloproliferative disorder.	Janus kinase 2	2015-07-31 17:34:20.498401	2015-07-31 17:34:20.498401	\N	f	\N
29	3815	KIT	c-KIT activation has been shown to have oncogenic activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), melanomas, lung cancer, and other tumor types. The targeted therapeutics nilotinib and sunitinib have shown efficacy in treating KIT overactive patients, and are in late-stage trials in melanoma and GIST. KIT overactivity can be the result of many genomic events from genomic amplification to overexpression to missense mutations. Missense mutations have been shown to be key players in mediating clinical response and acquired resistance in patients being treated with these targeted therapeutics.	v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog	2015-07-31 17:34:20.709912	2015-07-31 17:34:20.709912	\N	f	\N
30	3845	KRAS	Mutations in the RAS family of proteins have frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations, G12, G13 and Q61. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeted these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.

35	4869	NPM1	AML with mutated NPM1 is provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested for in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Evaluation of FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development.	nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin)	2015-07-31 17:34:22.035395	2015-07-31 17:34:22.035395	\N	f	\N

37	5290	PIK3CA	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.	phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha	2015-07-31 17:34:22.485737	2015-07-31 17:34:22.485737	\N	f	\N

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) in APL patients harboring the PML-RARA fusion. Recent interest has been shown in combining ATRA and arsenic trioxide for treating these patients, and early results seem promising.	promyelocytic leukemia	2015-07-31 17:34:22.897383	2015-07-31 17:34:22.897383	\N	f	\N

42	5979	RET	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.	ret proto-oncogene	2015-07-31 17:34:23.558501	2015-07-31 17:34:23.558501	\N	f	\N

44	23451	SF3B1	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with K700E described as a major hotspot mutation. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts).	splicing factor 3b, subunit 1, 155kDa	2015-07-31 17:34:24.078376	2015-07-31 17:34:24.078376	\N	f	\N
45	7157	TP53	TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. Loss of tumor suppressors is most recognized by large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide variants, or missense mutations. These variants are also very broadly distributed throughout the gene, not localizing in any particular hotspot. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) have been found to have prognostic impact on patient outcomes.	tumor protein p53	2015-07-31 17:34:24.323191	2015-07-31 17:34:24.323191	\N	f	\N

48	7307	U2AF1	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.

1	4	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the philadelphia chromosome, is the most well-studied fusion gene in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but despite its ability initiate disease in mice, its status an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.348937	2015-07-31 17:34:26.348937	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2	4	BCR-ABL T315I	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of seleciton have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.377346	2015-07-31 17:34:26.377346	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of seleciton have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation E255K has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.398081	2015-07-31 17:34:26.398081	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
5	1	EML4-ALK	The EML4-ALK fusion has been seen in non-small cell lung cancer, and appears to be an alternative mechanism for ALK activation. Cells with this fusion have been shown to be sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.439731	2015-07-31 17:34:26.439731	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
6	1	EML4-ALK C1156Y	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, this variant has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.457967	2015-07-31 17:34:26.457967	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

13	5	V600E/V600M	A case study of a single patient harboring both a V600E and a V600M mutation, dabrafenib was shown to acheive clinical response.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.603845	2015-07-31 17:34:26.603845	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
14	5	V600E AMPLIFICATION	Amplification of BRAF V600E has been shown to confer resistance to MEK inhibitors. For more information on the V600 locus, see the V600E entry.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.628626	2015-07-31 17:34:26.628626	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
17	5	V600	BRAF mutations of the valine 600 residue have been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of the V600 mutations, V600E is the most widely researched. V600 mutations as a whole have been correlated to poorer prognosis in colorectal and papilarry thyroid cancers. V600 mutations have also been shown to confer sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.

18	8	AMPLIFICATION	CCND1 amplification has been implicated in poorer prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.714039	2015-07-31 17:34:26.714039	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
19	8	EXPRESSION	CCND1 expression, and its prognositc impact, is still in dispute. Three experiments in non-small cell lung cancer have shown it to have no impact on survival, but three additional studies have shown it results in poorer prognosis. There is also some ambiguity in how the boundaries between expression and overexpression are defined.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.733404	2015-07-31 17:34:26.733404	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
20	8	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.755868	2015-07-31 17:34:26.755868	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
21	9	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated.

22	9	PROMOTER DEMETHYLATION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes.

Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.806265	2015-07-31 17:34:26.806265	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
23	10	LOSS	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.826749	2015-07-31 17:34:26.826749	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
24	11	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.856014	2015-07-31 17:34:26.856014	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
25	13	EXPRESSION	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.874544	2015-07-31 17:34:26.874544	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
26	12	EXPRESSION	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers.

27	14	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.923668	2015-07-31 17:34:26.923668	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
28	15	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.948886	2015-07-31 17:34:26.948886	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
29	15	MUTATION	CEBPA mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) and a favorable prognosis. However, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.970419	2015-07-31 17:34:26.970419	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
30	33	MEF2D-CSF1R	MEF2D-CSF1R is a fusion that has been observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia. In cell lines harboring this event, treatment with imatinib has shown notable sensitivity.	2015-07-31 17:34:26.990286	2015-07-31 17:34:26.990286	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
31	16	DNAJB1-PRKACA	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.011519	2015-07-31 17:34:27.011519	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
32	18	R882	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.032025	2015-07-31 17:34:27.032025	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
74	30	EXON 1 MUTATIONS	A study by Lièvre et al in 2006 showed that colorectal cancer patients with KRAS exon 1 mutations had low cetuximab response rates.	2015-07-31 17:34:28.031764	2015-07-31 17:34:28.031764	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

These fusions were also found to retain oligomerization capability, and result in enhanced cell proliferation. Cell lines harboring these fusions were shown to respond to pazopanib. Additionally, tumor size reduction was achieved by both ponatinib and pazopanib treatments administered separately in a single patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and this fusion.

55	24	ITD MUTATIONS	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.559614	2015-07-31 17:34:27.559614	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Although the majority of mutations are point mutations effecting D835 (most frequently D835Y), a small proportion involve an in-frame deletion of I836. These mutations are within the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 and thought to result in constitutive activation of the receptor.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.580298	2015-07-31 17:34:27.580298	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.	2015-07-31 17:34:28.09605	2015-07-31 17:34:28.09605	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
58	26	R132	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.642402	2015-07-31 17:34:27.642402	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy.

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, KRAS, and CDK2NA mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

33	19	L858R	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.060513	2015-07-31 17:37:42.607911	f	\N	\N	7	55259514	55259515	CT	AG	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
34	19	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.083137	2015-07-31 17:37:42.624471	f	\N	\N	7	55249071	55249071	C	T	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	2015-07-31 17:34:27.673566	2015-07-31 17:37:42.816628	f	\N	\N	2	209113113	209113113	G	A	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies.

116	45	R175H	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R175H variant seems not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also acts as a gain-of-function mutation that promotes tumorigenesis in mouse models. Cell lines harboring this mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been shown that the R175H mutation is correlated with worse overall survival than wild-type TP53, but is not as detrimental as the R248W variant.	2015-07-31 17:34:29.002979	2015-07-31 17:37:43.315676	f	\N	\N	17	7578406	7578406	C	T	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

5	Imatinib Resistance	While imatinib has shown to be incredibly successful in treating philadelphia chromosome positive CML, patients that have shown primary or secondary resistance to the drug have been observed to harbor T315I and E255K ABL kinase domain mutations. These mutations, among others, have been observed both in primary refractory disease and acquired resistance. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), PDGFRA 842 mutations have also been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. 	2015-07-31 17:35:38.267584	2015-07-31 17:35:53.507189	f	\N
14	ALK Fusions	ALK fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated as its own subset of NSCLC. Many ALK fusions that have been seen as recurrent in cancer serve to increase the activity of the ALK oncogene relative to normal cells. While EML4 is the most common fusion partner, other 5' partners have been observed. The EML4-ALK fusion has shown sensitivity to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib. 	2015-07-31 17:35:46.006103	2015-07-31 17:35:53.521411	f	\N
15	EGFR TKI Resistance	EGFR pathway activation is a nearly ubiquitous hallmark of cancer. Many tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to target EGFR pathway activity. One such inhibitor, erlotinib, has demonstrated efficacy in an EGFR over-active setting. However, the T790M missense mutation has shown to confer resistance to this inhibitor in cell lines and case studies.  	2015-07-31 17:35:47.567504	2015-07-31 17:35:53.533707	f	\N
6	Crizotinib Resistance	The ALK oncogene has long been considered a driving factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor criztonib has shown to be effective in ALK-mutant NSCLC. However, in patients that have shown acquired resistance to crizotinib, missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain have shown to drive this resistance. 	2015-07-31 17:35:38.461276	2015-07-31 17:35:53.544946	f	\N
8	Other V600's	While BRAF V600E is nearly ubiquitous in many cancer types, other V600 variants have also been observed and studied to a lesser degree. At first approximation, many of these variants seem to behave similarly to V600E, and treatment with dabrafenib has been shown to be effective. 	2015-07-31 17:35:40.096225	2015-07-31 17:35:53.560823	f	\N
16	HER2 Activating	HER2-positive breast cancer is widely recognized as a molecular subtype of breast cancer. While amplification of ERBB2 is a common mechanism for activation of the pathway, missense mutations have also demonstrated activation potential. These activating missense mutations also confer senstivity to the targeted therapeutic neratinib. 	2015-07-31 17:35:47.894729	2015-07-31 17:35:53.5728	f	\N
17	ESR1 Ligand-Binding Domain	ER-positive breast cancer is the most common of the breast cancer subtypes. Hormone therapy has been widely effective in treating the disease, however sequencing of resistant patients has uncovered a number of missense mutations in mediating this resistance. Many of these mutations lie within the ligand-binding domain, and contribute to constitutive activity of the receptor. This has lead to the development of estrogen receptor degrading agents such as fulvestrant, which have shown early efficacy in clinical trials.  	2015-07-31 17:35:48.375451	2015-07-31 17:35:53.587014	f	\N
10	FGFR fusions	FGFR fusions have been demonstrated across many cancer types to have oncogenic potential. FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been shown to be fused to many 3' partners, which may act as a vehicle for pathway activation. Treatment of cell lines harboring FGFR2 fusions with pazopanib has shown mild "anti-tumor" activities, and both ponatinib and pazopanib have shown efficacy in case studies.  	2015-07-31 17:35:42.376362	2015-07-31 17:35:53.598952	f	\N
18	PTEN Loss-of-Function	PTEN loss is a common event in breast cancer, as well as others. The most common single nucleotide variant resulting in PTEN loss is a R233 nonsense mutation. Cell lines harboring this mutation behave similarly to cell lines harboring larger insertion or deletion events, in that they both respond to PI3K-mTOR inhibitors with impeded growth. 	2015-07-31 17:35:52.129485	2015-07-31 17:35:53.613343	f	\N
9	Motesanib Resistance	RET activation is a common oncogenic marker of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Treatment of these patients with the targeted therapeutic motesanib has shown to be effective. However, the missense mutations C634W and M918T have shown to confer motesanib resistance in cell lines. 	2015-07-31 17:35:40.155176	2015-07-31 17:35:53.626745	f	\N
12	TSC Loss	Inactivating events in TSC1 and TSC2 have been observed in a number of cancer types. Cell lines and case studies have shown that in the loss of TSC, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has seen significant anti-tumorigenic activity. 	2015-07-31 17:35:44.75343	2015-07-31 17:35:53.644916	f	\N
13	BRCA Germline Variants	BRCA germline variants have long been recognized as important potential predictors of breast and ovarian cancer risk. 	2015-07-31 17:35:45.446651	2015-07-31 17:35:53.658828	f	\N

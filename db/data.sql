1	1	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 238\nname: ALK\ndescription: ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving\n  events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy\n  in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance\n  to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied\n  success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been\n  shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.\nofficial_name: anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	026c10f9-f937-4efd-9536-46578fe8aaf5	2015-02-18 20:00:00.931441
2	2	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 207\nname: AKT1\ndescription: AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, is a known oncogene. AKT\n  activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the\n  pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been\n  shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown\n  to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.\nofficial_name: v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	00ed8d4a-ff6a-4165-a716-353563d2ddaf	2015-02-18 20:00:01.402788

This finding has brought\n  new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.\nofficial_name: A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	a691b638-6906-4b77-aa65-a2144d107c96	2015-02-18 20:00:01.797722
4	4	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 25\nname: ABL1\ndescription: ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein\n  that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this\n  fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook\n  of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer\n  resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase\n  inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are\n  currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.\nofficial_name: ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	f750f24a-be24-4afb-add2-0ffd45214a7f	2015-02-18 20:00:02.441972

Of these,\n  the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E\n  has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along\n  with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is\n  also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK\n  inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations\n  have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there\n  is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\nofficial_name: B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	c4037fdb-98b4-4fca-9056-2219e1a19e81	2015-02-18 20:00:02.861713

Well\n  established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent\n  kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development\n  efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated\n  are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation.\n  While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin\n  D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been\n  shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are\n  no FDA-approved targeted therapies.\nofficial_name: cyclin D1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	f4f6e50f-9626-4ae0-ba96-cc9c09546ddd	2015-02-18 20:00:03.187375

Well\n  established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent\n  kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development\n  efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated\n  are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation.\n  Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared\n  to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study,\n  the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival\n  of the cyclin D3 knockouts.\nofficial_name: cyclin D3\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	1d823b04-6c29-4672-8033-d2f1a070b7ca	2015-02-18 20:00:03.707398
9	9	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 898\nname: CCNE1\ndescription: Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its cyclin D counterparts,\n  has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and\n  colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression,\n  have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements\n  are correlated with later stage disease. In lung cancer, neoplastic cells with higher\n  levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their more lowly\n  expressed counterparts.\nofficial_name: cyclin E1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	39ec2a2f-2eaa-4448-9e9f-e1ce9cd970ee	2015-02-18 20:00:03.956822

One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is\n  palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has\n  also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors\n  to PI3K inhibitors.\nofficial_name: cyclin-dependent kinase 6\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	bc4756a8-30e4-448e-9fc0-c00f80e50e51	2015-02-18 20:00:04.210075

12	12	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1029\nname: CDKN2A\ndescription: CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer\n  types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic\n  impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. One mechanism by which loss\n  of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene.\n  However, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively\n  ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with\n  hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being\n  said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic\n  indicator.\nofficial_name: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	dff10cb8-1c9b-4047-8efa-21ce1b7458b6	2015-02-18 20:00:04.657664
13	13	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1050\nname: CEBPA\ndescription: AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification\n  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients\n  with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal\n  AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation\n  in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha\n  protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription\n  factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1\n  and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations\n  may have prognostic implications.\nofficial_name: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	e07cae9d-6c95-4e55-af2a-c1b573a77e9c	2015-02-18 20:00:04.880911

In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1\n  to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In\n  one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional\n  studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.\nofficial_name: DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	d0ef9eba-0fa2-4bd7-8f7f-9822e6962258	2015-02-18 20:00:05.07648

16	16	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1788\nname: DNMT3A\ndescription: DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently\n  mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically\n  normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant\n  negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers.\n  AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to\n  be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also\n  indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner\n  from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes\n  and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A\n  mutations.\nofficial_name: DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	224c4d19-7af0-4789-b1ad-ad1b45e9dd44	2015-02-18 20:00:05.542527

Amplification\n  and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role\n  in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts.\n  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably\n  gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance\n  to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized\n  as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have\n  seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of\n  the EGFR locus has become a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer.\nofficial_name: epidermal growth factor receptor\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	109e519a-46e9-495b-83ad-8fc185c33045	2015-02-18 20:00:05.800304
18	18	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 2064\nname: ERBB2\ndescription: ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is amplified in HER2-positive breast\n  cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast cancer.\n  Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical\n  importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown senitivity\n  to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical\n  sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.\nofficial_name: erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	62448a53-e786-4b2e-8f42-7c4b2955957c	2015-02-18 20:00:06.024093

ER-positive breast\n  cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing efforts\n  to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the\n  ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance\n  and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that\n  act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently\n  in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing\n  efforts in treating breast cancer.\nofficial_name: estrogen receptor 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	82bdd132-3b19-4191-91bd-9282194bfe01	2015-02-18 20:00:06.261131

Activation of these receptors can lead to activation\n  of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by\n  which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors\n  has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have\n  been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions have been demonstrated\n  to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics\n  ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR\n  signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially\n  in lung cancer patients.\nofficial_name: fibroblast growth factor receptor 2\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	9af159c7-534c-4350-8b23-33f32593a73c	2015-02-18 20:00:06.482742

In myelodysplastic syndromes\n  and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been shown to be associated\n  with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically\n  normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma\n  and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival\n  than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1\n  mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q\n  deletions.\nofficial_name: isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	708feab1-66a3-447e-befd-b1a80c375281	2015-02-18 20:00:07.339698

1	238	ALK	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.	anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase	2015-02-18 20:00:00.86171	2015-02-18 20:00:00.86171	\N
2	207	AKT1	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, is a known oncogene. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.	v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1	2015-02-18 20:00:01.382511	2015-02-18 20:00:01.382511	\N
3	369	ARAF	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.	A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase	2015-02-18 20:00:01.773309	2015-02-18 20:00:01.773309	\N
4	25	ABL1	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.	ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase	2015-02-18 20:00:02.421464	2015-02-18 20:00:02.421464	\N
5	673	BRAF	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.

6	595	CCND1	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	cyclin D1	2015-02-18 20:00:03.163646	2015-02-18 20:00:03.163646	\N

The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation.

8	896	CCND3	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts.	cyclin D3	2015-02-18 20:00:03.685923	2015-02-18 20:00:03.685923	\N
9	898	CCNE1	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its cyclin D counterparts, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. In lung cancer, neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their more lowly expressed counterparts.	cyclin E1	2015-02-18 20:00:03.940078	2015-02-18 20:00:03.940078	\N
10	1021	CDK6	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	cyclin-dependent kinase 6	2015-02-18 20:00:04.185504	2015-02-18 20:00:04.185504	\N

12	1029	CDKN2A	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. One mechanism by which loss of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. However, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A	2015-02-18 20:00:04.633855	2015-02-18 20:00:04.633855	\N
13	1050	CEBPA	AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha	2015-02-18 20:00:04.85339	2015-02-18 20:00:04.85339	\N
14	3337	DNAJB1	DNAJB1 works upstream of MDM2, stabilizing the complex and facilitating p53 turnover. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.	DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1	2015-02-18 20:00:05.06145	2015-02-18 20:00:05.06145	\N
15	5566	PRKACA	"PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity."	protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, catalytic, alpha	2015-02-18 20:00:05.295214	2015-02-18 20:00:05.295214	\N
16	1788	DNMT3A	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A mutations.	DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha	2015-02-18 20:00:05.523864	2015-02-18 20:00:05.523864	\N
17	1956	EGFR	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer.	epidermal growth factor receptor	2015-02-18 20:00:05.773982	2015-02-18 20:00:05.773982	\N
18	2064	ERBB2	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is amplified in HER2-positive breast cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast cancer. Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown senitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2	2015-02-18 20:00:05.998682	2015-02-18 20:00:05.998682	\N
19	2099	ESR1	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, but has also shown significance in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types. ER-positive breast cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	estrogen receptor 1	2015-02-18 20:00:06.237604	2015-02-18 20:00:06.237604	\N
20	2263	FGFR2	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.	fibroblast growth factor receptor 2	2015-02-18 20:00:06.455189	2015-02-18 20:00:06.455189	\N

22	2322	FLT3	FLT3 is an important cytokine receptor involved in normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.	fms-related tyrosine kinase 3	2015-02-18 20:00:06.900816	2015-02-18 20:00:06.900816	\N

24	3417	IDH1	IDH1 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble	2015-02-18 20:00:07.32415	2015-02-18 20:00:07.32415	\N

33	4869	NPM1	AML with mutated NPM1' is provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested for in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Evaluation of FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development.	nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin)	2015-02-18 20:00:09.216876	2015-02-18 20:00:09.216876	\N

35	5290	PIK3CA	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.	phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha	2015-02-18 20:00:09.737838	2015-02-18 20:00:09.737838	\N

40	5979	RET	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.	ret proto-oncogene	2015-02-18 20:00:10.901655	2015-02-18 20:00:10.901655	\N

42	23451	SF3B1	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with K700E described as a major hotspot mutation. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts).	splicing factor 3b, subunit 1, 155kDa	2015-02-18 20:00:11.322717	2015-02-18 20:00:11.322717	\N

46	7307	U2AF1	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.

1	4	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the philadelphia chromosome, is the most well-studied fusion gene in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but despite its ability initiate disease in mice, its status an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.474586	2015-02-18 20:00:12.474586
2	4	BCR-ABL T315I	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of seleciton have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.511597	2015-02-18 20:00:12.511597
3	4	BCR-ABL E255K	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of seleciton have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation E255K has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.54056	2015-02-18 20:00:12.54056
4	2	E17K	AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase ihibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.568381	2015-02-18 20:00:12.568381
5	1	EML4-ALK	The EML4-ALK fusion has been seen in non-small cell lung cancer, and appears to be an alternative mechanism for ALK activation. Cells with this fusion have been shown to be sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.616947	2015-02-18 20:00:12.616947
6	1	C1156Y	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, this variant has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.644498	2015-02-18 20:00:12.644498
7	1	L1196M	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, this variant has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.669755	2015-02-18 20:00:12.669755
8	1	F1174L	ALK F1174L has been observed as recurrent in neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells containing this mutation have shown resistance to low doses of criztonib. However, increased dosage can overcome this resistance in cell lines studies. TAE684 has also proven effective in both NSCLC and neuroblastoma F1174L containing cells.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.70084	2015-02-18 20:00:12.70084
9	1	R1275Q	ALK R1275Q has been observed as a recurrent mutation in  neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells with this mutation have shown sensitivity to the ALK-inhibitor TAE684. This, and the geldanamycin deriviative 17-DMAG, has been shown to be effective in NSCLC cell lines.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.725346	2015-02-18 20:00:12.725346
10	3	S214C	ARAF S214C has been found to be a recurrent oncogenic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It has been shown to confer sensitivity to sorafenib and trametenib in cell lines. In a case study of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring this mutation, sorafenib also acheived near-complete clinical remission. This case has brought more interest to the variant from a research and clinical perspective.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.750098	2015-02-18 20:00:12.750098

12	5	V600E	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, KRAS, and CDK2NA mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. While the drugs cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.804353	2015-02-18 20:00:12.804353

17	5	V600	BRAF mutations of the valine 600 residue have been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of the V600 mutations, V600E is the most widely researched. V600 mutations as a whole have been correlated to poorer prognosis in colorectal and papilarry thyroid cancers. V600 mutations have also been shown to confer sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.

19	6	EXPRESSION	CCND1 expression, and its prognositc impact, is still in dispute. Three experiments in non-small cell lung cancer have shown it to have no impact on survival, but three additional studies have shown it results in poorer prognosis. There is also some ambiguity in how the boundaries between expression and overexpression are defined.	2015-02-18 20:00:12.987126	2015-02-18 20:00:12.987126
75	27	EXON 9	c-KIT exon 9 mutations lie within the dimerization motif of the protein. Relative to other KIT mutations, exon 9 mutations have been associated with better overall survival.

20	6	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.01427	2015-02-18 20:00:13.01427

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.107393	2015-02-18 20:00:13.107393
24	9	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.136734	2015-02-18 20:00:13.136734
25	11	EXPRESSION	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.167374	2015-02-18 20:00:13.167374

27	12	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.227615	2015-02-18 20:00:13.227615
28	13	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.264392	2015-02-18 20:00:13.264392

30	31	MEF2D-CSF1R	MEF2D-CSF1R is a fusion that has been observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia. In cell lines harboring this event, treatment with imatinib has shown notable sensitivity.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.33136	2015-02-18 20:00:13.33136
31	14	DNAJB1-PRKACA	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.358693	2015-02-18 20:00:13.358693
32	16	R882	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.385849	2015-02-18 20:00:13.385849
76	27	L576P	KIT L576P is an exon 11 mutation that lies within the juxtamembrane domain. It is one of the most recurrent KIT mutations in melanoma, and both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to imatinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.6741	2015-02-18 20:00:14.6741
33	17	L858R	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.414593	2015-02-18 20:00:13.414593
34	17	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.	2015-02-18 20:00:13.443334	2015-02-18 20:00:13.443334

This evidence has led to an increased use of targeted sequencing of the estrogen receptor in breast and ovarian cancer. Y536Q is one of these ligand binding domain mutations, and is commonly implicated in this hormone resistance.

60	22	ITD	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.213679	2015-02-18 20:00:14.213679
61	22	TKD	FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (aka FLT3-TKD) are much less common than FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations and may not confer the same prognostic impact. Although the majority of mutations are point mutations effecting D835 (most frequently D835Y), a small proportion involve an in-frame deletion of I836. These mutations are within the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 and thought to result in constitutive activation of the receptor.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.244492	2015-02-18 20:00:14.244492
62	23	EXPRESSION	GATA2 misregulation has been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies, as well as non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of over-active GATA2 pathways using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has shown dramatic tumor regression in lung cancer.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.275537	2015-02-18 20:00:14.275537
63	24	R132	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.307899	2015-02-18 20:00:14.307899

67	25	R140Q/L	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R140Q/L mutants have shown improved overall survival as compared to their wild-type counterparts.

68	25	R172K	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R172K mutation has been linked with poorer prognosis and worse overall survival than IDH2 wild-type patients. However, in myelodisplastic syndromes, studies did not find a prognostic association between this variant and patient outcomes.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.451847	2015-02-18 20:00:14.451847
69	26	V617F	JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases, occuring in around half of all MPD's. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.481915	2015-02-18 20:00:14.481915

71	27	EXON 11	c-KIT mutations in exon 11 lie within the juxtamembrane domain, and are very recurrent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, often bearing a poorer prognosis than other KIT mutations. Cells harboring exon 11 mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, offering a better prognosis to patients treated with the drug in the first year.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.53769	2015-02-18 20:00:14.53769
72	27	EXON 13	c-KIT exon 13 mutations are relatively rare compared to other c-KIT mutations. These mutations lie within the tyrosine kinase 1 domain, and are found primarily in melanoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Cell lines harboring these mutations show sensitivity to imatinib and sunitinib treatment. However, only imatinib has seen use in clinical settings to date, with sunitinib entering trials in imatinib-resistant cases.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.565276	2015-02-18 20:00:14.565276
73	27	EXON 14	c-KIT exon 14 mutations lie within the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein. While relatively rare in primary gastrointestinal tumors, they are notably more prevalent in refractory disease, suggesting a role in imatinib resistance. Unlike mutations in other KIT exons, exon 14 mutations seem relatively rare in melanoma.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.59349	2015-02-18 20:00:14.59349
74	27	EXON 17	c-KIT exon 17 mutations lie within the TK2 domain, containing the activation loop of the protein. In cell lines, mutations within this domain have been shown to be sensitive to imatinib. However, in double KIT mutants in which the exon 17 mutation is a secondary mutation, cell lines have shown resistance to both imatinib and sunitinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.622311	2015-02-18 20:00:14.622311
77	27	V654A	KIT V654A is an exon 13 mutation that lies within the tyrosine kinase 1 domain of the protein. It has been shown to be an activating mutation by in vitro studies. This mutation is associated with imatinib resistance in melanoma patients. However, second generation TKI's such as sunitinib and midostaurin (PKC 412) have seen success in acheiving tumor response.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.706492	2015-02-18 20:00:14.706492

80	28	G12	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.813647	2015-02-18 20:00:14.813647

86	29	P124S	MAP2K1 P124S is a recurrent mutation in melanoma, and is seen in bladder and colon cancer to a lesser degree. The P124S mutation has been shown to contribute to AZD6244 resistance in melanoma cell lines, but considerably less so than its Q56P counterpart.	2015-02-18 20:00:14.982827	2015-02-18 20:00:14.982827

89	32	PROMOTER METHYLATION	MGMT promoter methylation has been observed to impact tumor progression in glioblastoma multiforme. In patients exhibiting promoter methylation, the akylating agent carmustine has shown efficacy. In patients lacking methylation, combining carmustine with the MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine may be effective, but more experiments are required. Clinical trials have also shown selective sensitivity of promoter methylation-positive patients to temozolomide, making a case for wider methylation screening in GBM patients.	2015-02-18 20:00:15.066703	2015-02-18 20:00:15.066703
90	33	EXON 12	NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurance with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.	2015-02-18 20:00:15.093563	2015-02-18 20:00:15.093563
91	33	W288FS	NPM1 W288fs (aka NPM1-A) is located in exon 12 of NPM1 and is the most common NPM1 mutation identified in acute myeloid leukemia. This mutation results in cytoplasmic localization of NPM1 (NPM1c) which is associated with a good response to induction therapy. Although it is the most extensively studied NPM1 exon 12 mutation, it is generally grouped with other exon 12 mutations for patient analysis (see NPM1 Exon 12 variants for more information).	2015-02-18 20:00:15.122783	2015-02-18 20:00:15.122783

98	34	Q61	NRAS Q61 mutations have been found in multiple myeloma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and others. Two melanoma patients, each harboring mutations at this locus (Q61L and Q61R), responded to treatment with the akylating agent temozolomide. However, in colorectal cancer patients, mutations at this locus have been shown to confer resistance to cetuximab. The prognostic impact of mutations at this locus is currently under study.	2015-02-18 20:00:15.330582	2015-02-18 20:00:15.330582

106	35	E542K	PIK3CA E545K/E542K are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer, and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab.

119	43	R175H	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R175H variant seems not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also acts as a gain-of-function mutation that promotes tumorigenesis in mouse models. Cell lines harboring this mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been shown that the R175H mutation is correlated with worse overall survival than wild-type TP53, but is not as detrimental as the R248W variant.	2015-02-18 20:00:15.929029	2015-02-18 20:00:15.929029

1	ALK Fusions	ALK fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated as its own subset of NSCLC. Many ALK fusions that have been seen as recurrent in cancer serve to increase the activity of the ALK oncogene relative to normal cells. While EML4 is the most common fusion partner, other 5' partners have been observed. The EML4-ALK fusion has shown sensitivity to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib. 	2015-02-18 20:00:16.5592	2015-02-18 20:00:40.421858
14	Erlotinib Resistance	EGFR pathway activation is a nearly ubiquitous hallmark of cancer. Many tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to target EGFR pathway activity. One such inhibitor, erlotinib, has demonstrated efficacy in an EGFR over-active setting. However, the T790M missense mutation has shown to confer resistance to this inhibitor in cell lines and case studies.  	2015-02-18 20:00:40.3668	2015-02-18 20:00:40.443728
11	Other V600's	While BRAF V600E is nearly ubiquitous in many cancer types, other V600 variants have also been observed and studied to a lesser degree. At first approximation, many of these variants seem to behave similarly to V600E, and treatment with dabrafenib has been shown to be effective. 	2015-02-18 20:00:22.14916	2015-02-18 20:00:40.44866
7	HER2 Activating	HER2-positive breast cancer is widely recognized as a molecular subtype of breast cancer. While amplification of ERBB2 is a common mechanism for activation of the pathway, missense mutations have also demonstrated activation potential. These activating missense mutations also confer senstivity to the targeted therapeutic neratinib. 	2015-02-18 20:00:19.117424	2015-02-18 20:00:40.451201
6	FGFR fusions	FGFR fusions have been demonstrated across many cancer types to have oncogenic potential. FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been shown to be fused to many 3' partners, which may act as a vehicle for pathway activation. Treatment of cell lines harboring FGFR2 fusions with pazopanib has shown mild "anti-tumor" activities, and both ponatinib and pazopanib have shown efficacy in case studies.  	2015-02-18 20:00:18.513096	2015-02-18 20:00:40.457854
10	NPM1 exon 12	To be filled in by Dr. KK, resident blood expert and knower of all things hematology. :) :) :) 	2015-02-18 20:00:21.974762	2015-02-18 20:00:40.46087
12	PTEN Loss-of-Function	PTEN loss is a common event in breast cancer, as well as others. The most common single nucleotide variant resulting in PTEN loss is a R233 nonsense mutation. Cell lines harboring this mutation behave similarly to cell lines harboring larger insertion or deletion events, in that they both respond to PI3K-mTOR inhibitors with impeded growth. 	2015-02-18 20:00:22.389982	2015-02-18 20:00:40.463821
13	TSC Loss	Inactivating events in TSC1 and TSC2 have been observed in a number of cancer types. Cell lines and case studies have shown that in the loss of TSC, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has seen significant anti-tumorigenic activity. 	2015-02-18 20:00:22.534332	2015-02-18 20:00:40.467285
8	Imatinib Resistance	While imatinib has shown to be incredibly successful in treating philadelphia chromosome positive CML, patients that have shown primary or secondary resistance to the drug have been observed to harbor T315I and E255K ABL kinase domain mutations. These mutations, among others, have been observed both in primary refractory disease and acquired resistance. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), PDGFRA 842 mutations have also been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. 	2015-02-18 20:00:19.544629	2015-02-18 20:03:50.549683
2	Crizotinib Resistance	The ALK oncogene has long been considered a driving factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor criztonib has shown to be effective in ALK-mutant NSCLC. However, in patients that have shown acquired resistance to crizotinib, missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain have shown to drive this resistance. 	2015-02-18 20:00:16.641489	2015-02-18 20:03:50.558092
3	ESR1 Ligand-Binding Domain	ER-positive breast cancer is the most common of the breast cancer subtypes. Hormone therapy has been widely effective in treating the disease, however sequencing of resistant patients has uncovered a number of missense mutations in mediating this resistance. Many of these mutations lie within the ligand-binding domain, and contribute to constitutive activity of the receptor. This has lead to the development of estrogen receptor degrading agents such as fulvestrant, which have shown early efficacy in clinical trials.  	2015-02-18 20:00:17.043142	2015-02-18 20:03:50.564173
9	Motesanib Resistance	RET activation is a common oncogenic marker of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Treatment of these patients with the targeted therapeutic motesanib has shown to be effective. However, the missense mutations C634W and M918T have shown to confer motesanib resistance in cell lines. 	2015-02-18 20:00:19.720976	2015-02-18 20:03:50.570869

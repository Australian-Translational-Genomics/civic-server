1	1	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 238\nname: ALK\ndescription: ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving\n  events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy\n  in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance\n  to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied\n  success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been\n  shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.\nofficial_name: anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	6b6bab8e-b2f1-476f-8b4a-d33d62114a32	2015-02-05 21:09:34.326053
2	2	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 207\nname: AKT1\ndescription: AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, has been known as an oncogene\n  for quite some time. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized\n  as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of\n  AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations\n  in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors\n  in vitro.\nofficial_name: v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	073374a6-7722-42d1-8a55-04ed32dca6d1	2015-02-05 21:09:34.537239

This finding has brought\n  new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.\nofficial_name: A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	37604d6a-2b88-46e2-9843-fc7006d29bd3	2015-02-05 21:09:34.746168
4	4	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 25\nname: ABL1\ndescription: ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein\n  that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment of cells harboring\n  this fusion has shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic\n  outlook of the disease. However, mutations in this gene have been shown to confer\n  resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase\n  inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are\n  currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.\nofficial_name: ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	0a14915e-491c-4d95-8431-c6af9c9b6cdd	2015-02-05 21:09:35.047094
5	5	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 673\nname: BRAF\ndescription: BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these,\n  the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E\n  has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along\n  with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is\n  also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK\n  inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations\n  have also been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types,\n  there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid\n  cancer.\nofficial_name: B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	b0ddca48-6499-467b-acb1-a5f2b61f4178	2015-02-05 21:09:35.255005

Well\n  established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent\n  kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development\n  efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are\n  widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes.\n  While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin\n  D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been\n  shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are\n  no FDA-approved targeted therapies.\nofficial_name: cyclin D1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	8d1a89d4-3393-4c58-ae07-c3785354ba5c	2015-02-05 21:09:35.479521

Well\n  established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent\n  kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development\n  efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are\n  widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes.\n  Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared\n  to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study,\n  the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival\n  of the cyclin D3 knockouts.\nofficial_name: cyclin D3\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	1fc864a1-0c17-4bad-8a38-24bad8373774	2015-02-05 21:09:35.890613
9	9	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 898\nname: CCNE1\ndescription: Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as it's counterparts,\n  cyclin D, has been shown to implicated in various carcinomas, including breast,\n  gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification\n  or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma,\n  and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. It has also been\n  shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of\n  the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.\nofficial_name: cyclin E1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	62e6db9c-482f-41c0-b424-673d61d46dad	2015-02-05 21:09:36.070554

One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is\n  palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has\n  also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors\n  to PI3K inhibitors.\nofficial_name: cyclin-dependent kinase 6\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	5f86d908-378d-428b-a673-e2c91ccf4d5d	2015-02-05 21:09:36.251636

12	12	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1029\nname: CDKN2A\ndescription: CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer\n  types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter\n  region for the gene. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical\n  trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The\n  prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many\n  studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for\n  patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients.\n  This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted\n  prognostic indicator.\nofficial_name: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	24666169-4064-4044-95b9-2f7b404d01be	2015-02-05 21:09:36.648273
13	13	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1050\nname: CEBPA\ndescription: "'AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification\n  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients\n  with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal\n  AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation\n  in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha\n  protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription\n  factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1\n  and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations\n  may have prognostic implications."\nofficial_name: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	fd8ec0a9-a5b2-411c-8525-5ca12d13b2d6	2015-02-05 21:09:36.86771

In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1\n  to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. A\n  study has found this fusion in every FL-HCC sample sequenced, and in vitro assays\n  have shown that the fusion retains kinase function.\nofficial_name: DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	17be0f57-d2b6-43e4-a5b0-4fb4adba3c0d	2015-02-05 21:09:37.049991
15	15	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 5566\nname: PRKACA\ndescription: PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate\n  resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation\n  hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular\n  fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be\n  a diagnostic marker. A study has found this fusion in every sample sequenced, and\n  in vitro assays have shown that the fusion retains kinase function.\nofficial_name: protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, catalytic, alpha\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	8e853277-c6dc-4133-ae88-67df783ac82f	2015-02-05 21:09:37.312955
16	16	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1788\nname: DNMT3A\ndescription: DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently\n  mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically\n  normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant\n  negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers.\n  AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to\n  be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also\n  indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner\n  from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes\n  and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A\n  mutations.\nofficial_name: DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	0f10a352-9051-4a5a-b340-bf2806570195	2015-02-05 21:09:37.504328
17	17	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 1956\nname: EGFR\ndescription: EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification\n  and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role\n  in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts.\n  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have show efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably\n  gefitinibb and erlotinib. mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance\n  to these drugs however, and the variant T790M has been functionally characterized\n  as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have\n  seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of\n  the EGFR locus has been a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer.\nofficial_name: epidermal growth factor receptor\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	3e36bcac-3c9f-42f4-9749-ceb5c58b4ea7	2015-02-05 21:09:37.727377
18	18	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 2064\nname: ERBB2\ndescription: ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is seen to be amplified in HER2-positive\n  breast cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast\n  cancer. Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to\n  have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown\n  senitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance\n  of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.\nofficial_name: erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	97e7ca2b-74a7-49df-9bb2-7ac512653d54	2015-02-05 21:09:37.929906
19	19	Gene	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	create	---\nentrez_id: 2099\nname: ESR1\ndescription: ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, and has shown\n  significance in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types as well. ER-positive\n  breast cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing\n  efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations\n  in the ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance\n  and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that\n  act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently\n  in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing\n  efforts in treating breast cancer.\nofficial_name: estrogen receptor 1\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	46e52686-2e85-401c-b1fb-eba65af0d03a	2015-02-05 21:09:38.153161

The active proteins have the potential to activate\n  the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which\n  FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has\n  been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been\n  seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions have been demonstrated to\n  have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics\n  ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR\n  signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially\n  in lung cancer patients.\nofficial_name: fibroblast growth factor receptor 2\nclinical_description: \n	1	\N	\N	394ea043-257b-4fed-9cc1-1a9c3d9af4a8	2015-02-05 21:09:38.346255

1	238	ALK	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.	anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase	2015-02-05 21:09:34.295665	2015-02-05 21:09:34.295665	\N
2	207	AKT1	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, has been known as an oncogene for quite some time. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.	v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1	2015-02-05 21:09:34.525528	2015-02-05 21:09:34.525528	\N
3	369	ARAF	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.

4	25	ABL1	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment of cells harboring this fusion has shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, mutations in this gene have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.

5	673	BRAF	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.	B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase	2015-02-05 21:09:35.242871	2015-02-05 21:09:35.242871	\N
6	595	CCND1	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.	cyclin D1	2015-02-05 21:09:35.465957	2015-02-05 21:09:35.465957	\N

The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes.

8	896	CCND3	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts.	cyclin D3	2015-02-05 21:09:35.882359	2015-02-05 21:09:35.882359	\N
9	898	CCNE1	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as it's counterparts, cyclin D, has been shown to implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	cyclin E1	2015-02-05 21:09:36.059496	2015-02-05 21:09:36.059496	\N
10	1021	CDK6	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	cyclin-dependent kinase 6	2015-02-05 21:09:36.240865	2015-02-05 21:09:36.240865	\N

12	1029	CDKN2A	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A	2015-02-05 21:09:36.633876	2015-02-05 21:09:36.633876	\N

13	1050	CEBPA	'AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.

14	3337	DNAJB1	DNAJB1 works upstream of MDM2, stabilizing the complex and facilitating p53 turnover. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. A study has found this fusion in every FL-HCC sample sequenced, and in vitro assays have shown that the fusion retains kinase function.

15	5566	PRKACA	PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker. A study has found this fusion in every sample sequenced, and in vitro assays have shown that the fusion retains kinase function.	protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, catalytic, alpha	2015-02-05 21:09:37.305776	2015-02-05 21:09:37.305776	\N
16	1788	DNMT3A	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A mutations.

17	1956	EGFR	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have show efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinibb and erlotinib. mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs however, and the variant T790M has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has been a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer.	epidermal growth factor receptor	2015-02-05 21:09:37.71585	2015-02-05 21:09:37.71585	\N
18	2064	ERBB2	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is seen to be amplified in HER2-positive breast cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast cancer. Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown senitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2	2015-02-05 21:09:37.918669	2015-02-05 21:09:37.918669	\N
19	2099	ESR1	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, and has shown significance in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types as well. ER-positive breast cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.	estrogen receptor 1	2015-02-05 21:09:38.141041	2015-02-05 21:09:38.141041	\N
20	2263	FGFR2	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. The active proteins have the potential to activate the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.	fibroblast growth factor receptor 2	2015-02-05 21:09:38.335576	2015-02-05 21:09:38.335576	\N

22	2322	FLT3	FLT3 is an important cytokine receptor involved in normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.	fms-related tyrosine kinase 3	2015-02-05 21:09:38.815865	2015-02-05 21:09:38.815865	\N

33	4869	NPM1	'AML with mutated NPM1' is provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested for in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Evaluation of FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development.	nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin)	2015-02-05 21:09:41.109276	2015-02-05 21:09:41.109276	\N

35	5290	PIK3CA	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating  , the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.	phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha	2015-02-05 21:09:41.532254	2015-02-05 21:09:41.532254	\N

40	5979	RET	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.	ret proto-oncogene	2015-02-05 21:09:42.533064	2015-02-05 21:09:42.533064	\N

42	23451	SF3B1	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with K700E described as a major hotspot mutation. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts).	splicing factor 3b, subunit 1, 155kDa	2015-02-05 21:09:42.92424	2015-02-05 21:09:42.92424	\N

46	7307	U2AF1	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.

1	4	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the philadelphia chromosome, is the most well-studied fusion gene in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but despite its ability initiate disease in mice, its status an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.091574	2015-02-05 21:09:46.091574
2	4	BCR-ABL T315I	While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of seleciton have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.107094	2015-02-05 21:09:46.107094
3	2	E17K	AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase ihibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.118125	2015-02-05 21:09:46.118125
4	1	EML4-ALK	The EML4-ALK fusion has been seen in non-small cell lung cancer, and appears to be an alternative mechanism for ALK activation. Cells with this fusion have been shown to be sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.128943	2015-02-05 21:09:46.128943
5	1	EML4-ALK C1156Y	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, this variant has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.143651	2015-02-05 21:09:46.143651
6	1	EML4-ALK L1196M	In patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibiting EML4-ALK fusion, this variant has been shown to confer resistance to crizotinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.158198	2015-02-05 21:09:46.158198
7	1	F1174L	ALK F1174L has been observed as recurrent in neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells containing this mutation have shown resistance to low doses of criztonib. However, increased dosage can overcome this resistance in cell lines studies. TAE684 has also proven effective in both NSCLC and neuroblastoma F1174L containing cells.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.174848	2015-02-05 21:09:46.174848
8	1	R1275Q	ALK R1275Q has been observed as a recurrent mutation in  neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells with this mutation have shown sensitivity to the ALK-inhibitor TAE684. This, and the geldanamycin deriviative 17-DMAG, has been shown to be effective in NSCLC cell lines.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.186428	2015-02-05 21:09:46.186428
9	3	S214C	ARAF S214C has been found to be a recurrent oncogenic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It has been shown to confer sensitivity to sorafenib and trametenib in cell lines. In a case study of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring this mutation, sorafenib also acheived near-complete clinical remission. This case has brought more interest to the variant from a research and clinical perspective.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.197364	2015-02-05 21:09:46.197364
10	5	V600D	Patients harboring mutations in valine 600 residue of BRAF have been shown to be sensitive to dabrafenib. For more information on the V600 locus, see the V600E entry.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.209274	2015-02-05 21:09:46.209274
11	5	V600E	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, KRAS, and CDK2NA mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. While the drugs cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.222816	2015-02-05 21:09:46.222816

16	5	V600	BRAF mutations of the valine 600 residue have been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of the V600 mutations, V600E is the most widely researched. V600 mutations as a whole have been correlated to poorer prognosis in colorectal and papilarry thyroid cancers. V600 mutations have also been shown to confer sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.

18	6	EXPRESSION	CCND1 expression, and its prognositc impact, is still in dispute. Three experiments in non-small cell lung cancer have shown it to have no impact on survival, but three additional studies have shown it results in poorer prognosis. There is also some ambiguity in how the boundaries between expression and overexpression are defined.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.31053	2015-02-05 21:09:46.31053

The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.384173	2015-02-05 21:09:46.384173
25	9	OVEREXPRESSION	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.394981	2015-02-05 21:09:46.394981

28	12	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.43065	2015-02-05 21:09:46.43065

32	14	DNAJB1-PRKACA	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.484586	2015-02-05 21:09:46.484586
125	43	R249W	This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts.

33	16	R882	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.498192	2015-02-05 21:09:46.498192

35	17	L858R	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.528944	2015-02-05 21:09:46.528944
36	17	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. The third generation TKI's are being developed with this resistance problem in mind, and early stage experiments have shown some efficacy of these drugs in previously resistant tumors with mutant EGFR.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.542684	2015-02-05 21:09:46.542684

These fusions were also found to retain oligomerization capability, and result in enhanced cell proliferation. Cell lines harboring these fusions were shown to respond to pazopanib. Additionally, tumor size reduction was achieved by both ponatinib and pazopanib treatments administered separately in a single patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and this fusion. The authors use these cases to highlight the need for enhanced clinical sequencing efforts.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.851334	2015-02-05 21:09:46.851334

61	22	ITD	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.908939	2015-02-05 21:09:46.908939
62	22	TKD	FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (aka FLT3-TKD) are much less common than FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations and may not confer the same prognostic impact. Although the majority of mutations are point mutations effecting D835 (most frequently D835Y), a small proportion involve an in-frame deletion of I836. These mutations are within the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 and thought to result in constitutive activation of the receptor.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.919638	2015-02-05 21:09:46.919638
63	23	EXPRESSION	GATA2 misregulation has been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies, as well as non-small cell lung cancer.

64	24	R132	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	2015-02-05 21:09:46.947218	2015-02-05 21:09:46.947218

69	25	R140Q/L	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R140Q/L mutants have shown improved overall survival as compared to their wild-type counterparts. In myelodysplastic syndromes, however, no prognostic link was discovered between IDH2 mutation status and overall survival.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.022494	2015-02-05 21:09:47.022494
70	25	R172K	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia, the R172K mutation has been linked with poorer prognosis and worse overall survival than IDH2 wild-type patients. However, in myelodisplastic syndromes, studies did not find a prognostic association between this variant and patient outcomes.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.034241	2015-02-05 21:09:47.034241
71	26	V617F	JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases, occuring in around half of all MPD's. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.053145	2015-02-05 21:09:47.053145

73	27	EXON 11	c-KIT mutations in exon 11 lie within the juxtamembrane domain, and are very recurrent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, often bearing a poorer prognosis than other KIT mutations. Cells harboring exon 11 mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, offering a better prognosis to patients treated with the drug in the first year.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.085589	2015-02-05 21:09:47.085589
74	27	EXON 13	c-KIT exon 13 mutations are relatively rare compared to other c-KIT mutations. These mutations lie within the tyrosine kinase 1 domain, and are found primarily in melanoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Cell lines harboring these mutations show sensitivity to imatinib and sunitinib treatment. However, only imatinib has seen use in clinical settings to date, with sunitinib entering trials in imatinib-resistant cases.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.10167	2015-02-05 21:09:47.10167
75	27	EXON 14	c-KIT exon 14 mutations lie within the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein. While relatively rare in primary gastrointestinal tumors, they are notably more prevalent in refractory disease, suggesting a role in imatinib resistance. Unlike mutations in other KIT exons, exon 14 mutations seem relatively rare in melanoma.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.11781	2015-02-05 21:09:47.11781
76	27	EXON 17	c-KIT exon 17 mutations lie within the TK2 domain, containing the activation loop protein. In cell lines, mutations within this domain have been shown to be sensitive to imatinib. However, in double KIT mutants in which the exon 17 mutation is a secondary mutation, cell lines have shown resistance to both imatinib and sunitinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.132725	2015-02-05 21:09:47.132725
77	27	EXON 9	c-KIT exon 9 mutations lie within the dimerization motif of the protein. Relative to other KIT mutations, exon 9 mutations have been associated with better overall survival.

78	27	L576P	KIT L576P is an exon 11 mutation that lies within the juxtamembrane domain. It is one of the most recurrent KIT mutations in melanoma, and both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to imatinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.160462	2015-02-05 21:09:47.160462
79	27	V654A	KIT V654A is an exon 13 mutation that lies within the tyrosine kinase 1 domain of the protein. It has been shown to be an activating mutation by in vitro studies. This mutation is associated with imatinib resistance in melanoma patients. However, second generation TKI's such as sunitinib and midostaurin (PKC 412) have seen success in acheiving tumor response.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.173767	2015-02-05 21:09:47.173767

82	28	G12	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.233945	2015-02-05 21:09:47.233945

88	29	P124S	MAP2K1 P124S is a recurrent mutation in melanoma, and is seen in bladder and colon cancer to a lesser degree. The P124S mutation has been shown to contribute to AZD6244 resistance in melanoma cell lines, but considerably less so than its Q56P counterpart.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.315894	2015-02-05 21:09:47.315894

91	32	PROMOTER METHYLATION	MGMT promoter methylation has been observed to impact tumor progression in glioblastoma multiforme. In patients exhibiting promoter methylation, the akylating agent carmustine has shown efficacy. In patients lacking methylation, combining carmustine with the MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine may be effective, but more experiments are required. Clinical trials have also shown selective sensitivity of promoter methylation-positive patients to temozolomide, making a case for wider methylation screening in GBM patients.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.356002	2015-02-05 21:09:47.356002
92	33	EXON 12	NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurance with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.370872	2015-02-05 21:09:47.370872
93	33	W288FS	NPM1 W288fs (aka NPM1-A) is located in exon 12 of NPM1 and is the most common NPM1 mutation identified in acute myeloid leukemia. This mutation results in cytoplasmic localization of NPM1 (NPM1c) which is associated with a good response to induction therapy. Although it is the most extensively studied NPM1 exon 12, it is generally grouped with other exon 12 mutations for patient analysis (see NPM1 Exon 12 variants for more information).	2015-02-05 21:09:47.384955	2015-02-05 21:09:47.384955

108	35	E542K	PIK3CA E545K/E542K are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer, and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.555596	2015-02-05 21:09:47.555596

114	15	DNAJB1-PRKACA	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in a rare form of adolescent liver cancer, hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma. In a 2014 study, authors found Honeyman et al observed this fusion in all 15 of the FL-HCC cases they examined, and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.638148	2015-02-05 21:09:47.638148
115	39	R233*	PTEN R233* has been shown to be a loss of function mutation, and PTEN loss has been the subject of considerable research in breast cancer. PTEN loss may sensitize cells to PI3K-mTOR inhibition. While still being debated, there is data to support that PTEN loss is both associated with poorer prognosis, and no change in prognosis.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.651833	2015-02-05 21:09:47.651833

117	40	C634W	RET C639W has been implicated as an alternate mechanism of activating RET in medullary thyroid cancer. While there currently are no RET-specific inhibiting agents, promiscuous kinase inhibitors have seen some success in treating RET overactivity. Data suggests however, that the C639W mutation may lead to drug resistance, especially against the VEGFR-inhibitor motesanib.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.676032	2015-02-05 21:09:47.676032
118	40	M918T	RET M819T is the most common somatically acquired mutation in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). While there currently are no RET-specific inhibiting agents, promiscuous kinase inhibitors have seen some success in treating RET overactivity. Data suggests however, that the M918T mutation may lead to drug resistance, especially against the VEGFR-inhibitor motesanib. It has also been suggested that RET M819T leads to more aggressive MTC with a poorer prognosis.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.687947	2015-02-05 21:09:47.687947

121	43	R175H	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R175H variant seems not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also acts as a gain-of-function mutation that promotes tumorigenesis in mouse models. Cell lines harboring this mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been shown that the R175H mutation is correlated with worse overall survival than wild-type TP53, but is not as detrimental as the R248W variant.	2015-02-05 21:09:47.71965	2015-02-05 21:09:47.71965

134	47	EXON 7	WT1 exon 7 mutations have been shown to be recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia. Many sources have examined the prognostic impact of these, agreeing that the mutant exon 7 cohort is correlated with worse overall survival and a number of poor prognistic outcomes.

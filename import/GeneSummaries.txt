entrez_gene	Summary	SourcesALK	ALK amplifications, fusions and mutations have been shown to be driving events in non-small cell lung cancer. While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines. 	24889366, 23401436AKT1	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, has been known as an oncogene for quite some time. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.  	16095999, 15023437ARAF	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment. 	15676015, 24569458ABL1	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment of cells harboring this fusion has shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, mutations in this gene have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML. 	15719031, 17457302BRAF	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer. 	19724843, 23594689CCND1	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies. 	12432268, 24387133CCND2	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated.

Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies. 	12432268, 24387133CCND3	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts. 	12432268, 24387133CCNE1	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as it's counterparts, cyclin D, has been shown to implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts. 	14965268CDK6	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors. 	20370706, 24089445CDK4	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors. 	20370706, 24089445CDKN2A	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator. 	20473920, 23111194CEBPA	'AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications. 	19357394, 11242107, 9012825DNAJB1	DNAJB1 works upstream of MDM2, stabilizing the complex and facilitating p53 turnover. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. A study has found this fusion in every FL-HCC sample sequenced, and in vitro assays have shown that the fusion retains kinase function. 	24578576PRKACA	PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker. A study has found this fusion in every sample sequenced, and in vitro assays have shown that the fusion retains kinase function. 	24578576DNMT3A	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A mutations.	24167195, 24656771EGFR	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have show efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinibb and erlotinib. mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs however, and the variant T790M has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has been a common practice in non-small cell lung cancer. 	23953842, 18712184 ERBB2	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is seen to be amplified in HER2-positive breast cancer, and is treated in a separate manner than the other subtypes of breast cancer. Apart from being amplified, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown senitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer. 	16947083, 10878580ESR1	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, and has shown significance in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types as well. ER-positive breast cancer that is resistant to hormone therapy has instigated clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of the protein have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. This has spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that act to degrade the protein, rather than act as an antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success, highlighting the importance of sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer. 	24185510, 22279420FGFR2	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. The active proteins have the potential to activate the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.	18636142, 23558953FGFR3	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer.

Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.  	12951584, 19357394GATA2	N/A	IDH1	N/A	IDH2	N/A	JAK2	JAK2 is a kinase that is misregulated or mutated in a number of myeloproliferative diseases and cancers. The mutation V617F is the most clinically relevant variant, and is seen in around half of myeloproliferative disorders. 	KIT	N/A	KRAS	N/A	MAP2K1	N/A	MEF2D	N/A	CSF1R	N/A	MGMT	N/A	NPM1	'AML with mutated NPM1' is provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested for in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Evaluation of FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development. 	23226219, 19357394NRAS	N/A	PIK3CA	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating  , the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors. 	PDGFRA	N/A	PML	N/A	RARa	N/A	PTEN	N/A	RET	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.	18073307, 25465739RUNX1	N/A	SF3B1	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies and breast cancer. SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with K700E described as a major hotspot mutation. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts).	21995386, 24136165TP53	N/A	TSC1	N/A	TSC2	N/A	U2AF1	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.	25311244, 22158538WT1	N/A

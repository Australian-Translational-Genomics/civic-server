B	9569050	Cox univariate analysis, at 5 years, showed that both the relapse-free and overall survival of patients with TP53 mutations in either the conserved regions, within L2 and L3, or the codons that directly contact DNA is significantly worse (relative hazard rate (RHR) for RFS: 1.9, 2.0, 2.7 and 4.1 respectively; see Table 3) than those patients without mutations (WT, wild type), or with mutations in codons that are not conserved or are outside L2 and L3.

TSC1	7248	Frameshift truncation	N/A	somatic	Metastatic urothelial bladder cancer	6477	 Everolimus	6442177	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A patient with metastatic bladder cancer that responded well to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus was shown to harbor a TSC1 frameshift truncation mutation (c.1907_1908del, p.Glu636fs) and a nonsense NF2 mutation. 2/3 additional patients with TSC1 mutations also had mild responses to everolimus.

C	19966866	Both LSL-KrasG12D Tsc1L/L and LSL-KrasG12D Tsc1L/+ mice treated with rapamycin at 6 mg/kg intraperitoneally every other day showed a significant improvement in survival (Figure 5). A striking improvement in survival was seen in LSL-KrasG12D Tsc1L/L mice (median survival 2.9 vs 18.6 weeks, P=0.0018).	Mouse model		KK	3	1	TSC Loss
TSC1	7248	Loss-of-Function  	N/A	somatic	Bladder cancer	4007	 Everolimus	6442177	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Tumors expressing TSC1 or TSC2 mutations show notably more sensitivity to everolimus than their wild-type counterparts. 	B	22923433	This analysis revealed three additional tumors harboring nonsense mutations in TSC1, including two patients who had minor responses to everolimus (Fig. 1C; 17 and 24% tumor regression). A fourth patient with 7% tumor regression had a somatic missense TSC1 variant of unknown functional consequence. In contrast, tumors from eight of the nine patients showing disease progression were TSC1 wild type. Patients with TSC1-mutant tumors remained on everolimus longer than those with wild-type tumors (7.7 versus 2.0 months, P = 0.004) with a significant improvement in time to recurrence (4.1 versus 1.8 months; hazard ratio = 18.5, 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 162, P = 0.001).
